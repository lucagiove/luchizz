# Luchizz Roadmap

## future / features
    TODO setup rkhunter
    TODO setup sshd security
    TODO improve a real debug/verbose/normal mode
    TODO change to argparse

## next version

    TODO print warning on user rename or change also sudoers
    TODO detect luchizz version for the bash-profile and update
         probably even better to use an external file to be included and replaced
         after every luchizz attempt
    TODO setup mail notification
    TODO add screenrc profile

## version 0.2

    TODO create setup (completely change structure)

## KNOWN ISSUES

    FIXME handle returncode 1 in case of NO answer to apt-get
    FIXME handle stdout/err redirection
